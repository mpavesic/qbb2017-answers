Question 1: Briefly comment on the trends you see in the gut microbiota throughout the first week

The microbiota starts rather diverse, split among enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus, and cutilibacterium. 

The staphylococcus and cutilibacterium populations disappear for a few days, and then return to levels equivalent to day 0.
